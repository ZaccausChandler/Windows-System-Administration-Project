Drive Mapping Lab



Objective

Demonstrate the ability to create, verify, and troubleshoot mapped network drives in a Windows domain environment.



What I Completed in This Lab



Created Shared Network Locations

\- Created a shared folder on the server (example: \\\\Windows-22\\HR or your actual share path).

\- Verified the network path and confirmed share permissions were correctly set.



Mapped Network Drives on the Client Machine

\- Mapped the shared folder to a drive letter using:

&nbsp; - File Explorer → “Map Network Drive”

&nbsp; - Or through the command line using `net use`



Verified Drive Mapping via CMD

\- Ran the command "Net Use" to confirm:

\- Drive letter  

\- Status  

\- Network path  

\- Drive connectivity



Verified Mapped Drive in File Explorer

\- Captured screenshots showing:

\- The mapped drive listed under “This PC”

\- The correct drive letter

\- The shared folder being accessible
